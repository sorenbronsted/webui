View management
===============

The view should hold on the html fragment and on show and hidden operations it should be add and remove the html
to the dom. This will will not give unsurpriced effect when views contains same id elements.

Use html data- attributes to name the model data element to subscribe to. Utillize dart stream for this.
Eg:
	Input: data-map="Injury" data-map-key="created" data-format="dd-MM-yyyy"
will subscribe to map named "Injury" with key "created" and format the display value

Following data attributes is need:

	data-map: name of map
	data-map-key: name of map key
	data-format: display format
	data-uid: a specific map with a given uid
	data-type: casenumber|datetime|number
	data-list: name of map for eg options for select
	data-list-key: name of map key
